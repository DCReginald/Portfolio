                At the begginning of the website i focused mainly on four pages, which was the home, contact, blog and
                project. The concept is to make the website very simple to the eye, and for that i made a bit of
                research, and found a few websites. What i noticed about them was how they did not use a large amount of
                colour or added a lot of features, for this reason i decided to use quite basic colours, which were
                black and white, with a bit of gold. I also added some features such as the moving background on the
                contact page and tilting box on the home page, to keep the reader engaged.

            <p>
                The focus of this section making the website mobile friendly. For this i added and changed a few
                features on
                the pages such as the main, margins and added some code in the HTML to create the hamburger menu icon.

                The sitereport section was only about making a site-report page both desktop and mobile, to document the
                progress that wasd made throughout the website.
