            <h4>Introduction to Web development</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Web development is one of the core modules of my software enginnering degree.
                At the start of the module i was introduced to a platform called Visual Studio Code, which was going to
                be the main learning platform for the first half of the module. In the first few lessons we began with
                an introduction to HTML, more specifically the
                HTML5 language and its syntax, which is used to input the information that needs to be displayed on the
                website.
                This was then followed by the introduction to CSS3, a language used to style the
                website, which was seemingly complicated at first as it was more complex than HTML, but after a few
                lessons i was able to do quite confortably.
                The next lessons we were taught how to use the CSS to style the websites, making a menu bar, search
                bars, textboxes and animations. Which we then used to make our portfolio website, as module assignment.

            <h4>Master Branch </h4>
            <br>
            <div id="date">
                <p>Saturday 9th April 2022</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                For the website portfolio, the concept was to do something that looked fairly easy, simple and
                clickable not too
                colourful or bold. For this reason i used quite basic colours, black, white and a bit of gold. At the
                start I focused
                only on a few pages as i was still trying to figure out how i wanted the website to be displayed.

        <section>
            <h4>Desktop portfolio</h4>
            <br>
            <div id="date">
                <p>Friday 11th April 2022</p>
            </div>
            <img src="Desktop portfolio.png" alt="Desktop">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>

                In this section of the Website i added an extra page; the project page and made some changes. I used the
                grid layout to create the blog and project page in order for it to be displayed as a colums and added
                the box
                feature on the home page with the tilt animation just to create a bit of interaction for the user
                when navigating.

            <h4>Mobile optimization </h4>
            <br>
            <div id="date">
                <p>Friday 14th April 2022</p>
            </div>
            <img src="Mobile-optimization.png" alt="Mobile">
            <br>
            <p>The main focus on this branch was to make the website mobile friendly, for it to be used on a different
                device. The main feature that i added in this section was the hamburger icon , which i took as an
                example
                from a YouTube tutorial(link will be below) and also made a few minor changes to some of the CSS for it
                to fit better on a mobile.

            <h4>Sitereport</h4>
            <br>
            <div id="date">
                <p>Friday 15th April 2022</p>
            </div>
            <img src="Sitereport1.png" alt="Sitereport">
            <br>
            <p>
                The sitereport section, consisted of making a desktop and mobile site-report page. The reason that it
                was added much later was because of the contect of the page, as i had to talk about the progress of my
                website and had not yet gotten to the finishing stages.
